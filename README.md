## **Current Features Common to all pages**
###  **Header Element**
The header element sticks to the top of the page as the user scrolls up and down. I used this method to ensure the user always had easy of access to the menu as well as phone number.

#### *Logo:*
* The sites logo also doubles as the title for the business, it easily illustrates the business name and can easily be read and identified on the page.

* Keeping the logo in the same postion accross all devices ensures the name is always in a prominat location to the user.

#### *Navigation Bar:*
* The navigation bar appears on all pages. 
* It contains links to the 'locations', 'our journey', 'gallery' and menu to allow easy navigation around the website. 
* The user's current page will have the link underlined. 
* Hover over feature, which turns either underlines the hover link in desktop layout or highlights the link row in mobile layout.
* The phone number is also displayed in the header. Due to this being a potential main point of contact, this is set to always be displayed in line with the logo. In a desktop layout, it is situated on the right after the menu. In a mobile layout, this switches with the menu and is more central.
* The phone number uses a CallTo hyperlink, so if the user clicks the number while using a mobile device, it will automatically transffer the user to their phone app, with the number loaded.

## **Anchor Tags Within all Pages** 
* All text achor tags have had their color set to match the sites colour scheme, meaning the anchor tag did not look out of place, and to help destiguish it as different from the standard text on the page.
* On a hover event the achonr tags also underline to help denote an embbeded hyperlink.
* The courser was left to change to the browsers default courser for hyperlinks.

## **Footer**
* The footer includes direct links to all of the social media accounts.

* These icons were imported from font awesome using a local copy of the stored css and fonts. I decided to use a local source instead of using links in order to prevent any changes made by font awesome from causing potential issue with the fonts being displayed properly.

* The email address is listed within the footer. This is a MailTo hyperlink, so clicking on it will automatically bring up the users default mail software.

* The phone number is also listed within the footer. This also uses a CallTo hyperlink in the same way the header phone number does.

* In a mobile screen layout, all three sections stack ontop each other to provide a cleaner UX.

## **Typography**
* Throughout the page, there are two main fonts used:
  * Kaushan Script - For the logo and headings to give it a strong presence.
  * Molengo - For all other content text. 
  * sans-serif & cursive - is used for a backup fonts if there is trouble rending the above fonts.

* All fonts were sourced from Google fonts, as stated in the credits.
